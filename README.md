Pokemon battle system for game design practice using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Ongoing project)

How to play
-------------------

Click the start button to begin the game.

The player and enemy start the battle with a random assortment of six Pokemon.

Once the battle starts the only functional button at this time is FIGHT.

Each Pokemon has two attacks to use.

TIP: The only way to heal is by using REST. The only Pokemon with that ability are Starmie and Kadabra.
