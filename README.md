## Introduction

Pokemon battle system for game design practice using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## How to play

Click the start button to begin the game.

The player and enemy start the battle with a random assortment of six Pokemon. 
Once the battle starts the only functional button at this time is FIGHT.
Each Pokemon has two attacks to use.

TIP: The only way to heal is by using REST. The only Pokemon with that ability are Starmie and Kadabra.
